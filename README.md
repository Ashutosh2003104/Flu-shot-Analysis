### Detailed README for Flu Vaccination Prediction Project

#### Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of individuals receiving the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines based on demographic, behavioral, and health-related features. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify whether a person is likely to get vaccinated, which can help public health organizations target vaccination campaigns more effectively.

The project is implemented in Python and uses popular data science libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib` for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

#### Dataset
The dataset consists of two main files:
1. **`training_set_features.csv`**: Contains features (predictors) for each respondent, such as:
   - Demographic information (age, race, sex, income level, etc.)
   - Behavioral factors (e.g., avoidance of large gatherings, handwashing habits)
   - Health-related attributes (e.g., chronic medical conditions, health insurance status)
   - Opinions about vaccines (e.g., perceived effectiveness, risk of getting sick from the vaccine)

2. **`training_set_labels.csv`**: Contains the target variables for each respondent:
   - `h1n1_vaccine`: Binary label indicating whether the respondent received the H1N1 vaccine (1 = yes, 0 = no).
   - `seasonal_vaccine`: Binary label indicating whether the respondent received the seasonal flu vaccine (1 = yes, 0 = no).

The dataset is split into training and evaluation sets for model development and testing.

#### Key Steps in the Project

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - The dataset is loaded using `pandas`, and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the structure and distribution of the data.
   - Features include both numerical (e.g., age, income) and categorical (e.g., race, education level) variables.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Missing values are handled using `SimpleImputer` with a median strategy for numerical features.
   - Numerical features are scaled using `StandardScaler` to standardize the data for modeling.
   - Categorical features are dropped in this implementation, but they could be encoded (e.g., using one-hot encoding) in future iterations.

3. **Model Building**:
   - A logistic regression model is used as the base classifier.
   - Since there are two target variables (`h1n1_vaccine` and `seasonal_vaccine`), a `MultiOutputClassifier` is employed to handle multi-label classification.
   - The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on a held-out evaluation set.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model's performance is evaluated using ROC curves and AUC (Area Under the Curve) scores.
   - The AUC scores for both `h1n1_vaccine` and `seasonal_vaccine` predictions are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness.

5. **Prediction and Submission**:
   - The trained model is used to predict probabilities for the test set (`test_set_features.csv`).
   - Predictions are saved in the required submission format (`submission_format.csv`) for further evaluation or competition submission.

#### Key Files
- **`flushot_1_.csv`**: The main script containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`training_set_features.csv`**: Input file containing features for training the model.
- **`training_set_labels.csv`**: Input file containing target labels for training the model.
- **`test_set_features.csv`**: Input file containing features for making predictions on unseen data.
- **`submission_format.csv`**: Template file for saving predictions in the required format.
- **`my_submission.csv`**: Output file containing the final predictions for the test set.

#### Dependencies
To run the code, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

---

#### Results
- The model achieves an AUC score of approximately **0.829** for the combined predictions of H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines.
- ROC curves are plotted to visualize the trade-off between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) for both target variables.

---

#### Future Improvements
1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Incorporate categorical features by encoding them (e.g., one-hot encoding or target encoding).
   - Create new features based on domain knowledge to improve model performance.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Experiment with other machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks, to compare performance.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize hyperparameters for the logistic regression model.

4. **Handling Class Imbalance**:
   - Address potential class imbalance in the target variables using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.

#### How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository or download the script and dataset files.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Run the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or terminal).
4. The final predictions will be saved in `my_submission.csv`.

#### Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for building and evaluating a machine learning model to predict flu vaccination rates. The results can be used to inform public health strategies and improve vaccination outreach efforts. Future work can focus on enhancing the model's performance and generalizability.
